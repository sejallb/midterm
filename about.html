        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Sejal Bandil! I’m a student at NYU originally from California, and I'm passionate about exploring the vibrant culinary landscape of New York City. Each area offers unique flavors and experiences, from cozy diners serving the best brunch to elegant restaurants creating unforgettable fine dining moments. Food is more than just sustenance for me; it’s an adventure that brings people together, and I love discovering hidden gems and popular hotspots. I believe that every meal has a story, whether it's the chef's unique take on a classic dish or the atmosphere of a beloved local eatery. Always on the lookout for delicious spots, I enjoy trying new cuisines that reflect the diverse cultures of this incredible city. Join me on my journey as I explore the best dining experiences NYC has to offer!</p>
